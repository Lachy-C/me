TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week was very overwhelming as there was lots to digest all at once. Although I feel like I was thrown in the deep end I understand coding is a long process and I have a long journey ahead. I am excited to see how powerful python can be as I develop as a programmer as I continue to use it within my professional practice. I hope next week is less chaotic which will allow me to better focus on honing my skills.
