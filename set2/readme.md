TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

These tasks were a challenge however and tested my limited coding experience (and patience) however it was hugely rewarding when finished. They also helped start to understand the fundamental syntax and arguments skills that will take me throughout my career. Despite this I am still feeling overwhelmed due to the sheer amount of information I need to take in with language I am still struggling to get a good grasp on. I am hoping I can get on top of this sooner rather than later utilizing a code academy trail.
